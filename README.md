## Summary 
There is a positivity bias for reviews within the Vine program.  Even though there are less vine reviews 51.06% are rated with 5 stars.  If there was a bias with both types of reviews then the percentage of non-vine reviews that were 5 stars would be higher. It can be determined that Amazon is providing the reviewers with substantial incentive to rate higher on average. I would run a regression analysis to determine if other factors such as the verified purchase component has an affect on the rating.
